                    <h2>Our History</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>In a small town in the countryside, the Serdotte family noticed a growing need: many people suffered from allergies and discomfort caused by dust mites and dirt accumulated on sofas and upholstery. Maria, the matriarch, who has always been passionate about home care, decided to turn this concern into action. In 2018, with few resources but a lot of determination, she and her son Jo√£o started Limpa Sof√°s, a family business with the mission of promoting well-being through deep cleaning. Using homemade techniques and natural products at first, they began serving neighbors and friends, who soon praised the difference in air quality and the comfort of their furniture.</p>
                        <p>Over time, demand grew, and Limpa Sof√°s evolved. Jo√£o, who had skills in technology, researched advanced cleaning methods and invested in professional extraction and sanitization equipment. Maria, in turn, trained her daughter Ana to deal with customers, offering warm and personalized service. The company began to serve not only homes, but also offices and clinics, always emphasizing the importance of a dust mite-free environment for health. The Santos family's reputation spread, and word of mouth transformed the small initiative into a thriving business, with a loyal clientele that valued the dedication and care in each service.</p>
                        <p>Today, Limpa Sof√°s is a reference in the region, but maintains its family essence. Maria, Jo√£o and Ana continue to work together, now with a larger team, but without giving up on their original commitment: to bring well-being to people. They implemented awareness programs on the importance of regular cleaning, offering free tips on social media and workshops for the community. The company also adopted sustainable practices, using biodegradable products and reducing environmental impact. For the Serdotte family, each cleaned sofa is more than a service ‚Äî it is a way of taking care of the health and happiness of their customers, keeping alive the mission that brought them together from the beginning.</p>
